"keywords": "collection",

"summary": "<p>At some point in the last few years, it suddenly felt very important that I learn &amp; record my family's recipes. Partly, I knew that a lot of them weren't written down (or were, but were prepared from memory and the original recipe was no longer relevant), and if someone didn't capture them, they'd eventually be lost.</p>
<p>I think I also got the sense that this was the art the women in my family have created &amp; offered, but probably without much gratitude, and certainly not the fanfare deserved for an art that shaped our lives.</p>
<p>Like most things we call &quot;American&quot;, these recipes have no single origin. Some have been passed down for generations, but all were modified along the way&mdash;adding, changing, &amp; removing ingredients, and mixing ideas across families. Some were probably grabbed from <cite class="magazine">Bon Appetite</cite> or the back of an Entenmann's box. Similarly, I'd encourage you to add, change, &amp; remove what you see here.</p>
<p>Because this is a collection of mostly poetry, I don't expect you're a proficient baker or cook (as I am not). So, I'm spelling out procedures &amp; techniques that might seem obvious to the more advanced.</p>
<p>Finally, each recipe comes with specific measurements, but that's mostly because I didn't know how else to represent them digitally. (I feel like I should give you some starting point.) Unless I'm baking, I rarely measure anything out. I cook the amount of meat I have; I prepare an amount of veggies &amp; fruit that feels right; I season so that I can see the spice I'm adding. And since I'm not measuring by mass, these numbers aren't especially reliable. I encourage you to think of the measurements as a starting place, if you choose to acknowledge them at all.</p>"
